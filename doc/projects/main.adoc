== Introduction
This document provides guidelines for structuring and naming computer projects. Following these guidelines should provide the following benefits:

  - Promote a consistent style over various use cases.
  - Aide organization of files and information.

== Top-Level Project Directories
The project root is a record directory. The following subdirectories are typical in a project root:

  - `Concept/` - Files related to planning the project design.
  - `Design/` - Files related to the design of the project.
  - `Notes/` - Notes related to the project.
  - `Issues/` - Files related to project issues.
  - `Releases/` - Archives of project releases.

== Design Subdirectories
Inside the `Design/` directory, the contents are largely dependent on the project type.

=== Software Project
For software development projects, the following resource subdirectories may be used to structure the design files if applicable:

  - `app/` - The source code and resources for the project application.
  - `doc/` - Documentation related to the project; can be handled by a source code extraction utility e.g. Doxygen.
  - `examples/` - Example usage of the software.
  - `lib/` - The source code and resources for the project library.
  - `platform/` - Platform specific source code required by the application.
  - `tests/` - Unit tests and related files.
  - `utils/` - Various utilities used by the project application or library e.g. third-party libraries.
